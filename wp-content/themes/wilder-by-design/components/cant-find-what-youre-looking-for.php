    <h2>Want more designs?</h2>

    <p>With an ever-growing number of designs and products it's impossible for us to make every design available on every product.</p>

    <p>To help with this we have made it easy for you to ask for your favourite design on another product.</p>

    <p>Simply go to any product page featuring the design you like and scroll down past the 'Add to Basket' button.</p>

    <h3>'This design is also available in ...'</h3>
    <p>Clicking on this will give you a list of other products we have featuring the same design, simply click on one and it will take you straight there.</p>

    <h3>'I would like to see this design on a ...'</h3>
    <p>Clicking this will show a form where you can enter the type of product you would like to see the design on.</p>

    <p>We'll take a look at your request and get back to you.</p>

    <h4>Your feedback is invaluable so a huge thanks in advance :)</h4>
